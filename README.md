Invoice Detector
Overview
The Invoice Detector is a Python-based application designed to detect and extract invoice information from images or PDF documents. The application utilizes computer vision techniques and optical character recognition (OCR) to identify regions of interest within the document and extract relevant data such as invoice number, date, total amount, etc.

Features
Invoice Detection: Automatically locates invoices within images or PDF files.
Region of Interest Extraction: Identifies key regions within the invoice document, such as headers, tables, and footers.
